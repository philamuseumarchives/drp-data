Duchamp Research Portal Documentation

<a href="https://www.duchamparchives.org/">The Duchamp Research Portal (DRP)</a> is an online platform that aggregates a selection of digitized archival holdings and museum collections at three partner institutions (Philadelphia Museum of Art, Centre Ompidou, and the Association Marcel Duchamp) to make a significant portion of primary source materials related to Marcel Duchamp accessible and discoverable through a single interface.

Here you can bulk download the data driving the DRP in JSON and RDF.

For additional documentation such as data models and a technologies overview, please visit <a href="http://drp.museumbrowse.org/">http://drp.museumbrowse.org/</a>.

Thank you to our partners, <a href="https://www.designforcontext.com/">Design for Context</a>, for their design and development work for the DRP.
